# BankPro — Modern Microservice-Based Banking System

## 🚀 Overview

BankPro is a comprehensive backend banking system designed using a microservice architecture pattern with Spring Boot. This project simulates real-world banking operations such as customer onboarding, account handling, fund management, and dashboard aggregation, built with scalable, secure, and testable service-oriented architecture.

The goal is to give developers hands-on experience with microservices, multithreading, concurrency, secure RESTful APIs, and asynchronous service communication.

## 🔒 Security

* Password hashing with BCrypt
* Stateless authentication using JWT
* Role-based access control using `@PreAuthorize`
* Token-based API security

---

## 🔍 API Documentation

* Swagger UI: `http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html`
* OpenAPI Spec: `http://localhost:8080/v3/api-docs`

Each service exposes its own OpenAPI spec.

---

## 🎯 Features & Best Practices

* Clean Layered Architecture (Controller -> Service -> Repository)
* DTO-based request/response handling
* Strong validation using `javax.validation`
* Global exception handling using `@ControllerAdvice`
* Reusable `RequestResponse<T>` wrapper for all APIs
* Proper use of Java 21 features

---

## 🚪 Authentication & Authorization

* JWT tokens issued on login
* JWT parsed using filter in security config
* Token role-based authority check
* Only authenticated users can access protected routes

---

## 🪤 Concurrency & Performance

* Async operations using Java `CompletableFuture`
* Transaction logging using `ExecutorService`
* Balance checking logic using `Callable` + `Future`
* Parallel service calls in dashboard

---

## 🌐 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/bankpro.git
cd bankpro
```

### 2. Start MySQL

* Create databases: `bankpro_customer`, `bankpro_account`, etc.
* Update credentials in `application.properties`

### 3. Run Customer Service

```bash
cd customer-service
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

### 4. Open Swagger UI

```
http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html
```
